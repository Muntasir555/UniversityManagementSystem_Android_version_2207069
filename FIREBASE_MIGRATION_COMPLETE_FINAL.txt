✅ TROUBLESHOOTING:
===================

Issue: App won't build
Solution: Clean → Rebuild Project

Issue: "No such table" error
Solution: Uninstall app completely, then reinstall

Issue: Can't login as admin
Solution: Database should auto-create admin on first launch
         If not, uninstall and reinstall

Issue: No students showing
Solution: Register a test student first

Issue: Old Firebase error messages
Solution: You may have an old version cached
         - Uninstall completely
         - Clear Android Studio cache (File → Invalidate Caches)
         - Rebuild and reinstall


✅ MAINTENANCE:
===============

Backup Database:
- Device File Explorer → /data/data/.../databases/
- Copy university_management.db file

View Data:
- Android Studio → App Inspection → Database Inspector
- Or use DB Browser for SQLite

Reset Database:
- Admin Dashboard → "Reset Database"
- Deletes all data, recreates with default admin

Add New Tables:
1. Update DatabaseHelper.java onCreate()
2. Increment DATABASE_VERSION
3. Update onUpgrade() method
